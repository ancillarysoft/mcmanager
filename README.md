# Minecraft Manager (mcmanager)

## ABOUT

A bash framework for managing local Minecraft server and client software

Link: [mcmanager project on Github](https://github.com/ancillarysoft/mcmanager)
## USAGE

With an example system username "exampleuser", the framework root directory should reside at the following location:

```/home/exampleuser/data/gaming/minecraft/mcmanager```

_... more information coming soon_

## GENERAL REFERENCE

The project consists of three primary bases of operation:

  - `client`: Assets related to the Minecraft client software (the thing you play Minecraft with)
  - `main`: Overarching system-wide libraries, logs, etc
  - `server`: Assets related to the Minecraft server software

_... more information coming soon_

## TO-DO

 - Capture `git` verbosity via `gitctl.sh` script verbosity handler function
   - This will allow us to have all of that verbosity stored into local log files by default
 - Add message-type-related text coloring to all verbose messaging
 - Generate an official schema reference for `sourcelinks.json` files
