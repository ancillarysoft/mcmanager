## To-Do List

 - Capture `git` verbosity via `gitctl.sh` script verbosity handler function
   - This will allow us to have all of that verbosity stored into local log files by default
 - Add message-type-related text coloring to all verbose messaging
 - Generate an official schema reference for `sourcelinks.json` files
 - Integration with systemd for automated server startup etc.
 - World backup and restore processes
